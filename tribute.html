        <p>Suryakumar Yadav made his first-class debut against Delhi during the 2010-11 Ranji season. He had a great start to his career as he top-scored for Mumbai with a ell compiled 73 and was the only player to score a fifty in Mumbai's first innings. Since then, he has been a regular member of the side and has scored reasonably well in every season.

            Impressed by his talent, he received an IPL contract from Mumbai Indians in 2011, for whom he played a few IPL matches until 2013. He moved to Kolkata Knight Riders and was very handy lower down the order and played a few useful cameos for KKR. In fact, he played all the matches in IPL-7, primarily due to his incredible strike-rate.</p>
